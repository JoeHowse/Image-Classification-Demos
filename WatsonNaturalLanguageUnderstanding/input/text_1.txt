Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street. Maybe we could try that?

Pizza sounds delicious.

Pizza? That's good.

Yes! Pizza!

That's it. I'm done.

Congratulations, San Francisco, you've ruined pizza! First the Hawaiians and now you!

What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza? Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?
